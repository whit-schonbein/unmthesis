This is a LaTeX class for formatting a PhD dissertation in accordance with 
the guidelines specified by the office of Graduate Studies at the 
University of New Mexico, Albuquerque. 

At present, the formatting guidelines are from Fall 2020, and a dissertation 
using this class was accepted by Graduate Studies in November of 2020.

See the \example directory for a simple example illustrating how to use 
the various commands defined in the .cls file.

Note: As far as I know there are no restrictions on the packages you can use. 
For example, cleverref is OK.
